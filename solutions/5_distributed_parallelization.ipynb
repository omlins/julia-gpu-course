    "As a first step, we will look at the below 1-D diffusion code which solves the linear diffusion equations using a \"fake-parallelisation\" approach. We split the calculation on two distinct left and right domains, which requires left and right `H` arrays, `HL` and `HR`, respectively. In this \"fake parallelization\" code, the computations for the left and right domain are performed sequentially on one process, but they could be computed on two distinct processes if the needed boundary update (often referred to as halo update in literature) was done with MPI. The idea of this fake parallelization approach is the following:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "# Compute physics locally\n",
    "HL[2:end-1] .= HL[2:end-1] .+ dt*λ*diff(diff(HL)/dx)/dx\n",

    "Note that an HPC application will normally use non-blocking communication. That means that instead of `MPI.Send` and `MPI.Recv!` one can use `MPI.Isend` and `MPI.Irecv` to asynchronously launch the communication and wait then at the end of the boundary updates with `MPI.Wait!` or `MPI.Waitall!` for completion of the communication. Note also, that in an HPC application, the receiving calls should be made before the sending calls, in order to have the receiver ready when the sender wants to start to send (else the sender will have to write first into a buffer).
