    "`T_tot_lb` should be relatively close to `T_peak`. Nevertheless, one could do these computations at least three times faster. You may wonder why it is possible to predict that just looking at the code. It is because three of the four arrays that are updated every iteration are not computed based on their values in the previous iteration and their individual values could therefore be computed on-the-fly when needed or stored in the much faster on-chip memory as intermediate results; these three arrays would never need to be stored in main memory and read from there. Only the temperature array (`T`) needs inevitably to be read from main memory and written to it at every iteration as is computed based on its values from the previous iteration (and the entire temperature array is orders of magnitudes bigger than the available on-chip memory). In addition, the heat capacity array (`Ci`) needs to be entirely read at every iteration. To sum up, all but three of eleven full array memory reads or writes can be avoided. If we avoid them, we reduce the main memory accesses by more than a factor three and can therefore expect the code to be at least three times faster.\n",

Only the temperature array (`T`) needs inevitably to be read from main memory and written to it at every iteration as is computed based on its values from the previous iteration (and the entire temperature array is orders of magnitudes bigger than the available on-chip memory). In addition, the heat capacity array (`Ci`) needs to be entirely read at every iteration. To sum up, all but three of eleven full array memory reads or writes can be avoided. If we avoid them, we reduce the main memory accesses by more than a factor three and can therefore expect the code to be at least three times faster.\n",

Defining the $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ metric, we assume that 1) we evaluate an iterative stencil-based solver, 2) the problem size is much larger than the cache sizes and 3) the usage of time blocking is not feasible or advantageous (which is a reasonable assumption for real-world applications). An important concept is not to include fields within the effective memory access that do not depend on their own history (e.g. fluxes); such fields can be re-computed on the fly or stored on-chip. Defining a theoretical upper bound for $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ that is closer to the real upper bound is work in progress."
